        Blockchain, Web3 & Smart Contracts

        <h2>🚀 The Evolution of the Internet: From Web2 to Web3</h2>
        <p>
            The internet has undergone massive transformations, shifting from Web1 (static pages) to Web2 (interactive platforms like social media) and now, to Web3—the decentralized internet powered by blockchain technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike Web2, where platforms are controlled by tech giants, Web3 empowers users with decentralization, privacy, and ownership** over their data and assets.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🔗 Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain is the backbone of Web3. It is a distributed ledger that records transactions securely and transparently. Every block is linked to the previous one, ensuring **immutability** and preventing fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key features of blockchain:
            <ul>
                <li>✅ Decentralization – No single entity controls the network.</li>
                <li>✅ Security – Transactions are cryptographically secured.</li>
                <li>✅ Transparency – Anyone can verify the records.</li>
                <li>✅ Immutability – Once recorded, data cannot be altered.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>💡 Smart Contracts: The Heart of Web3</h2>
        <p>
            Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain. They automatically execute agreements based on predefined conditions, eliminating intermediaries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine buying real estate without a lawyer or broker—just a smart contract handling the process autonomously!
        </p>
        <p>
            Use cases of smart contracts:
            <ul>
                <li>💰 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – Enables lending, borrowing, and staking without banks.</li>
                <li>🎨 NFTs & Digital Art – Ensures ownership and royalties for artists.</li>
                <li>🚛 Supply Chain Management – Tracks goods with full transparency.</li>
                <li>🗳️ Decentralized Voting – Eliminates election fraud.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>

        <h2>⚡ Why It Matters for Bitcoin & The Future</h2>
        <p>
            Bitcoin started the revolution, proving that decentralized money is possible. Now, smart contracts and Web3 are extending these principles beyond just currency, unlocking endless possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The future is decentralized, and understanding blockchain is crucial for anyone looking to be a part of this transformation.
