My goal is to build impactful decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage blockchainâ€™s transparency and security.

Blog 1: My Journey into Crypto, Blockchain, and Web3

The Intersection of My Interests

From a young age, I have been fascinated by finance, coding, disruptive technologies, and investing. The fusion of these passions led me to explore the world of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3â€”a journey filled with self-education, hands-on experience, and overcoming challenges.

The Role of Self-Development

My learning journey has been heavily influenced by self-improvement books such as:
ðŸ“– The Psychology of Money â€“ Understanding financial behavior.ðŸ“– Rich Dad Poor Dad â€“ Gaining financial literacy.ðŸ“– Atomic Habits â€“ Building consistent learning habits.ðŸ“– Same as Ever â€“ Embracing change and long-term thinking.

These books reinforced my belief in continuous learning, financial discipline, and the importance of taking calculated risks.

From Dreaming to Investing

I always aspired to invest in cryptocurrency. However, legal age restrictions meant I had to wait for my PAN card and turning 18. Convincing my parents, who initially thought crypto was a scam, was a challenge. Through persistent discussions, research, and education, I gradually helped them understand the legitimacy of blockchain technology.

Now, I actively invest through platforms like CoinDCX while also exploring traditional investments via Zerodha.

Learning by Doing

I believe that the best way to learn is by doing. Watching YouTube videos introduced me to blockchain, but hands-on experience truly deepened my knowledge. Some key milestones:
âœ… Blockchain Certifications â€“ Learning fundamentals and applications.âœ… Building an IoT Blockchain Network for Supply Chains â€“ Applying blockchain to real-world problems.âœ… Exploring Smart Contracts & Solidity â€“ Setting up development environments and writing blockchain-based code.
